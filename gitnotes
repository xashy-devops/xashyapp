branching helps developers to work on different features , experiments , or bug fixes in an isolation from the main development line. 
A branch is represenrts an independent line of development in a git repository. 
it allows multiple streams of work to proceed simultanouly.
when a prject is initialised , a default branch is created called main or master. This branch could serve as the main development line. 

creating a branch: 

git branch [branchname]

checkout to a branch -->> git checkout branchname. 

git checkout -b branchname --->> create a branch from the branch where you are , then it checks you out to the branch. 

deleting a git branch: 

make sure you are not in the branch .........
git branch -d branchname 

git branch -D branchnam
